| Mobile plan recommendation with machine learning | The mobile operator has discovered that many customers are using outdated legacy tariffs. A system capable of analyzing customer behavior and offering them one of the new mobile plans was built.| Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn |

## Summary
- To find a model that would most effectively recommend the appropriate mobile plan for mobile operator's clients, I examined three different models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.
- The best model turned out to be RandomForestClassifier with a tree depth parameter of 10 and 50 trees.
- The accuracy of this model is close to 80% both on the training and testing data.
