| Data preprocessing | Based on the data from the bank's credit department, I researched the influence of marital status and the number of children on the timely loan repayment. | Python, Pandas |

## Research summary:

- The hypothesis regarding the correlation between the number of children and on-time loan repayment is generally confirmed: the more children a borrower has, the more likely they are to delay loan repayment. 
- Marital status indeed affects loan repayment behavior, and the hypothesis was correct. Clients who have never been married are more likely to default on loans. However, the difference between the group of married clients and the groups in civil partnerships or not in any partnership is not significant, about 2%.
- Comparing the two most numerous income groups in the sample 'C' (income 50001–200000) and 'B' (income 200001–1000000), it can be concluded that clients with higher incomes are more likely to repay loans on time. Therefore, the hypothesis is valid for these groups. However, groups A (highest income), E (lowest income), and D (30001-50000) are too small to draw precise conclusions.
- The relationship between the purpose of the loan and the likelihood of on-time repayment is confirmed. Loans related to real estate (7.26%) and wedding expenses (7.91%) are most likely to be repaid on time. On the other hand, loans for cars (9.35%) and education (9.25%) have a lower on-time repayment rate. Although there is a clear influence of the loan purpose, the difference in results is small, within approximately 2%.
