| [Finding the most profitable oil well using machine learning](https://github.com/gi-garif/data-science-and-analytics-projects/blob/main/Finding%20Most%20Profitable%20Oil%20Well%20using%20Machine%20Learning.ipynb) | The task was to build a model that can determine the region where oil extraction will yield the highest profit. By analyzing the given data and using machine learning techniques, I predicted which region is the most profitable for oil extraction. | *Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Bootstrap* |
