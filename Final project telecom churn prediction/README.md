## Summary:

**Project Summary: Predicting Customer Churn in Telecom**

This project focused on predicting customer churn in a telecom company. Through systematic data preprocessing, exploratory analysis and feature engineering, I developed a predictive model to identify potential churners accurately. After evaluating six models, CatBoost emerged as the top performer, achieving a training ROC-AUC of 0.88. This model was fine-tuned and applied to the test dataset, yielding a robust ROC-AUC of 0.89. Key insights revealed the significance of contract duration, charges and payment methods in predicting churn. By addressing challenges like class imbalance and feature selection, this project provides actionable insights to enhance customer retention strategies for the telecom company.
