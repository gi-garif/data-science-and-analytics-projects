## Summary:
- The console video game market is rapidly declining. The number of games released in the period 2014-2015 was significantly lower than during the peak sales period (2008-2009). The number of game releases has remained around 500 games per year for several years.

- The life cycle of a platform is about 6.5 years, but the most popular platforms were on the market for about 10 years.

- The top-selling consoles in recent years are PS4, XOne, and 3DS. Sales of the Wii, PS3, X360, and PSV series are insignificant. PC ranks fourth in sales in 2016.

- In general, the number of copies sold for a game does not exceed 0.2 million, slightly higher for XOne games. However, most platforms have individual games that sold significantly better than others, for example, the PS4 has games with sales of 12 and 15 million copies.

- When forecasting sales, it is advisable to rely on critic reviews: the higher the scores, the higher the sales. However, it should be noted that half of the games represented in the dataset do not have critic reviews. It is worth mentioning that 40% of games lack user ratings - it is likely that there is a correlation between user ratings and sales, but there is not enough data to study it.

- In 2014-2016, the most games were released in the Action genre. It is followed by RPG, Adventure, Sports, and Shooter genres.

- At the same time, the Adventure genre has some of the lowest sales. The best-selling genres are Shooter, Sports, Platform, Fighting, and RPG.

- There are significant differences between the main regional markets. In North America and Europe, games intended for mature audiences (17+) in the Shooter and Action genres are the most popular. PS4 is the most popular platform in Europe, while in the USA, PS4 shares the first place with XOne. In Japan, games are mainly purchased in the Role-Playing or Action genres intended for 3DS. The target age could not be determined as ESRB operates only in North America.

- The hypothesis that the average user ratings of the Xbox One and PC platforms do not differ was tested and confirmed.

- The hypothesis that the average user ratings of the Action and Sports genres do not differ was not confirmed.
