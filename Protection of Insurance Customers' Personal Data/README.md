| Protection of insurance customers' personal data | The task was to develop a method for data transformation to protect the personal information of customers in the insurance company. The goal was to ensure that it becomes difficult to reconstruct sensitive information from the transformed data. The method was designed in such a way that it does not deteriorate the performance of machine learning models trained on the transformed data. | Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn |

## Summary:
- Using the properties of matrices, I proved that the quality of linear regression does not change when multiplying features by a random invertible matrix.
- Based on this fact, I implemented a data encryption algorithm.
- By using the linear regression model, I confirmed that the quality of predictions does not deteriorate when using the encryption algorithm.
