The behavior of customers was analyzed, and optimal service packages were recommended for users.| *Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, SciPy* |
| [Final data analytics project](https://github.com/gi-garif/data-science-and-analytics-projects/blob/main/Final%20data%20analytics%20project.ipynb) | The research aims to assist the online store "Streamchik," a global retailer of computer games, in identifying popular video games to focus on and optimizing advertising campaigns. The objective was to identify patterns and factors that contribute to the success of games in order to make data-driven decisions.| *Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, SciPy* |
| [Mobile plan recommendation with machine learning](https://github.com/gi-garif/data-science-and-analytics-projects/blob/main/Mobile%20Plan%20Recommendation%20with%20Machine%20Learning.ipynb) | The mobile operator has discovered that many customers are using outdated legacy tariffs. A system capable of analyzing customer behavior and offering them one of the new mobile plans was built.| *Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn* |
| [Predicting customer churn with supervised learning](https://github.com/gi-garif/data-science-and-analytics-projects/blob/main/Predicting%20Customer%20Churn%20with%20Supervised%20Learning.ipynb) | The task at hand was to predict whether a customer will leave the bank in the near future or not. Historical data on customer behavior and contract terminations with the bank have been provided for analysis.| *Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn* |
| [Finding most profitable oil well using machine learning](https://github.com/gi-garif/data-science-and-analytics-projects/blob/main/Finding%20Most%20Profitable%20Oil%20Well%20using%20Machine%20Learning.ipynb) | The task was to build a model that can determine the region where oil extraction will yield the highest profit. By analyzing the given data and using machine learning techniques, I predicted which region is the most profitable for oil extraction. | *Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Bootstrap* |
| [Machine learning for predicting gold recovery coefficient](https://github.com/gi-garif/data-science-and-analytics-projects/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20for%20Predicting%20Gold%20Recovery%20Coefficient.ipynb) | The main objective of this project was to build a model that predicts the gold recovery rate from gold-bearing ore based on data with parameters related to mining and purification processes.| *Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Scikit-learn* |
| [Protection of insurance customers' personal data](https://github.com/gi-garif/data-science-and-analytics-projects/blob/main/Protection%20of%20Insurance%20Customers'%20Personal%20Data.ipynb) | The task was to develop a method for data transformation to protect the personal information of customers in the insurance company. The goal was to ensure that it becomes difficult to reconstruct sensitive information from the transformed data. The method was designed in such a way that it does not deteriorate the performance of machine learning models trained on the transformed data. | *Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn* |
| [Car price estimation using machine learning](https://github.com/gi-garif/data-science-and-analytics-projects/blob/main/Car%20Price%20Estimation%20using%20Machine%20Learning.ipynb) | The project involves developing a car valuation model for a used car marketplace app, which aims to attract new customers by providing a quick and accurate estimation of the market value of their cars. | *Python, Pandas, Lightgbm* |
| [Time series analysis](https://github.com/gi-garif/data-science-and-analytics-projects/blob/main/Time%20Series%20Analysis.ipynb) | The project involves building a taxi demand forecasting model for a taxi company based on historical taxi booking data at airports. The goal was to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour to better manage and attract more drivers during peak demand periods.| *Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels* |
| [Detecting comment toxicity using NLP](https://github.com/gi-garif/data-science-and-analytics-projects/blob/main/Detecting%20Comment%20Toxicity%20using%20NLP.ipynb) | The project involves developing a tool for an internet marketplace to detect toxic comments submitted by users in the product descriptions and reviews section.| *Python, Pandas, BERT, nltk, tf-idf* |
| [Determining customers age from photos using computer vision](https://github.com/gi-garif/data-science-and-analytics-projects/blob/main/Determining%20customers%20age%20from%20photos%20using%20computer%20vision.ipynb) | A chain supermarket is implementing a computer vision system to process photos of customers. Photo capture in the checkout area is supposed to help determine the age of customers, analyze their purchases and suggest products that may be of interest to customers in that age group. It will also monitor cashiers' integrity when selling alcohol. A model has been built to approximate a person's age based on their photo.| *Python, Keras* |
